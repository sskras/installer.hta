= Windows HTA-based application installer

=== The story

https://github.com/sskras[@sskras] thought it would be nice
to have a simple installation framework for Windows which:

  - would be text-based  +
    (could be fixed by hand / using notepad, with no rebuilding)

  - could run on as many retired NT versions as possible  +
    (going back to at least Win XP or even Win 2000)

  - would have no 3rd party dependencies  +
    (ones like Qt, Python, Perl, Lua, UI++)

So he ran some research and chose the Internet Explorer (IE)-based HTA
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application[HTML Application]
technology introduced in 1999 along with
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_5[IE5].

<details><summary>
IE5 was supported on these OSes:

++++

  - Windows 3.1x
  - Windows NT 3.51
  - Windows 95
  - Windows NT 4.0 SP3 or later
  - Windows 98
  - Mac OS X (up to v5.2.3)
  - Classic Mac OS (up to v5.1.7)
  - Solaris
  - HP-UX (up to 5.01 SP1)

By default it was bundled with:

  - Windows 98 Second Edition
  - Windows 2000
  - Windows ME

\... and so was the HTA support.

Which makes all three initial requirements satisfied.

=== Initial try

The initial idea is to have a single `.hta` file
which would contain all the logic and most of data,
and so would be a self-contained executable.

So at first some fundamental things were ironed out --
eg. a fixed size window having most of IE shortcut keys
disabled, and being resistant to potential UI joggling
using mouse.

I took https://gitlab.com/chrismbradford/osd-wizard/-/commit/e709f9b3e7a97b21c6ffa8f4bbee5a5d1151e160[OSD_HTA.hta]
from https://gitlab.com/chrismbradford/osd-wizard[gitlab.com/chrismbradford/osd-wizard]
repository as a code-wise inspiration.  +
I also used https://gburner-virtual-drive.en.lo4d.com/download[`gvd5-x64.exe`] installer
of https://www.gburner.com/download.htm[gBurner Free] as the reference UI design:

Basically it is a 640 x 480 size static window partitioned
into several rows via `<table>`, which uses `MS Shell Dlg 2`
font.

As of commit https://github.com/sskras/installer.hta/commit/ee221c0b6ad979b5a3149cccd7e17c7d5bc2e717[ee221c0]
it is a half assed mock-up of the aforementioned installer
window.

It looks like this on _Aug 04, 2025_:
